# First Steps with LiFT

## Java
There is no release yet. You need to import the whole project parallel to any other project using LiFT.

## Python
- You need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).
- Clone the project and in the project root run `poetry update`. This will install all required dependencies.
- To run the unit tests: `poetry run python -m pytest -s --cov`
